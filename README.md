# Data Cleaning Project  
- I completed this project inorder to brush up my Data Cleaning skills.  
- Now, it's tough to find super messy and raw data online or on Kaggle, and even if we find some it is either too small or it isn't worth performing any analysis.  
- We know Data Cleaning is an important part of any Data Analysis and Data Analytics process. Working with raw data is not ideal and can skew our analysis to a great extent.  
- The Dataset I used here is called the FIFA21 Players Dataset on Kaggle. The Football players' data is scraped from a website called [sofifa.com](SOFIFA).  
- It is a massive dataset consisting of players' demographic, biometric and game stat information and is ideal to analyse. However, it is very raw and unclean and thus I took it up for a Data Cleaning Project.  
- The repo consists of the unclean and clean data along with the source code used for cleaning the data.
